WIMP - Where Is My Prof?

Alwin is a wimpy kid. What? Is he lazy? Not at all! He always asks me, 'Where is my Prof?'. He is in search of his project and sick of waiting for hours in front of his Prof's office. Boom! He got an idea. He started to search the Prof's timetable and decided to meet him after his class. He went to ERP. Wow! What a beautiful place it is! He found the Prof's department and checked department time table, found out his slots, compared his slots with time and finally, he met him. But, alas! He was late. The Prof gave his project to another stud. Alwin asked him, 'Bro, how did you find him earlier?'. He replied, 'Use WIMP kid!'.
